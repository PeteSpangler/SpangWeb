# SpangWeb

This is my personal website. It holds my portfolio and other interesting things. It has begun as a Dockerized Flask Web App styled with Bootstrap 4, but I want to strip out the Bootstrap and implement Tailwind. I have some other ideas for future iterations, but that will most likely come first.

Other ideas: switching to a GitHub action CI/CD workflow to simplify deployment, a chorehub app, more personal writing, documenting my learning process, that sort of thing.
