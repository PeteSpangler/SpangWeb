# SpangWeb

This is my personal website. It holds my portfolio and other interesting things. It has begun as a Dockerized Flask Web App styled with Bootstrap 4, but I have migrated to ASP.NET MVC.

Other ideas: switching to a GitHub action CI/CD workflow to simplify deployment, a chorehub app, more personal writing, documenting my learning process, that sort of thing.
